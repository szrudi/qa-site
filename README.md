You can check out the current state hosted on Netlify:

The goal of the project is to learn as much as I can about the mentioned technologies.
So I want to be sure, that I understand and can reason about every line of code that is on the master branch.
To achieve this I've read and watched a lot of blogposts, tutorials, videos, documentation about every element used in the project.

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
